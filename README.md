There are plenty of options to the user to customize their conditions for capturing the time. Options include:

* Capture time for Data Entry - Save OR Mark Survey as Complete

* Capture time for Survey - Completion

* Capture time for Survey - Save & Return Later, Next Page, and/or Previous Page for **all survey pages**

* Capture time for Survey - Save & Return Later, Next Page, and/or Previous Page only for **the page containing the field**

The user can also choose how often to capture the time, as well as specify email address/addresses to receive error messages if any errors occur.

## Notes
